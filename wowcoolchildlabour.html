        <p>Child labor is a grave violation of children's rights, depriving millions of young minds of their education, health, and fundamental freedoms. Around the world, countless children are forced into work, sacrificing their childhood to support their families and survive. This issue is not just a statistic but a pressing human rights challenge that demands our immediate attention.</p>

        <h2>Description of the Issue</h2>
        <p>Child labor encompasses any work that is mentally, physically, socially, or morally dangerous and harmful to children. It deprives them of the opportunity to attend school, compelling them to leave school prematurely or attempt to combine school with heavy work. According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), there are approximately 160 million child laborers worldwide, with the highest incidence in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia.</p>
        
        <h3>Facts and Statistics</h3>

            <li>70% of child laborers work in agriculture, often in hazardous conditions.</li>
